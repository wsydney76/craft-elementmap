```bash

## Usage

When editing an entry, category, or user in the full-page editor, you will be presented a panel in the sidebar with two lists.

1. **References to This Element** lists the elements which contain the currently edited element somewhere in their fields. These elements could be entries, categories, tags, assets, users, or globals.

2. **References to Other Elements** lists the elements which the currently edited element contains somewhere in its fields. These elements could be entries, categories, tags, assets, or users.

Both lists provide links to the related elements' editors or control panel sections for quick access.
